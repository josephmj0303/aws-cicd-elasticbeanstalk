A production-style **CI/CD pipeline implementation on AWS** that automatically builds and deploys an application using **AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.

This project demonstrates how modern DevOps pipelines automate application delivery from source code commit to production deployment.

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **fully automated CI/CD pipeline** for deploying a web application using AWS managed services.

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Developer pushes code to **Bitbucket repository**
2. **AWS CodePipeline** detects the change
3. Code is sent to **AWS CodeBuild**
4. Application build artifacts are generated
5. Artifacts are stored in **Amazon S3**
6. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** deploys the new application version
7. Application runs on EC2 instances and connects to **Amazon RDS**

The result is an automated deployment pipeline that enables **fast and reliable application releases**.

# 🔧 Build Process (CodeBuild)

The application build is handled by **AWS CodeBuild** using a `buildspec.yml` file.

Build stages:

1️⃣ Install dependencies

2️⃣ Compile application

3️⃣ Package application artifact

4️⃣ Upload artifact to S3

5️⃣ Deploy through Elastic Beanstalk

---

# 🚀 Deployment using Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk simplifies application deployment by automatically provisioning:

* EC2 instances
* Load balancer
* Auto Scaling
* Health monitoring
* Deployment management

Application versions are deployed directly from **CodePipeline**.
